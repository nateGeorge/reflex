# reflex

**A tiny "decision model" you can run on your own GPU.**

You give it some information (a support ticket, a document, a photo) and a list of
questions with fixed answer options. It answers _all_ the questions at once and tells you
**how sure it is about each option**, as percentages. It never writes free text, so it can
never make up an answer that isn't on your list.

It is an open re-creation of [Jev](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev),
the "System One" model TypeSafe released in September 2026, built on top of a normal
open-weights model ([Qwen3.5-4B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B) by default).

```
state:     "My payouts have failed three times this week and nobody replied to my emails."

question   which team?        ->  payments 99.9%   account 0.04%   other 0.04%
question   escalate?          ->  yes 90%
question   how urgent (0-2)?  ->  1.9   (low 4%  medium 1%  high 95%)
question   refund requested?  ->  yes 2%
```

That whole answer comes back in about 200 ms, and faster once the state is cached. Your
code then decides what to do with the numbers ("auto-route if above 90 %, otherwise ask a
human").

## Status

**What it is.** One HTTP endpoint, `POST /v1/systemone`, answered by a single forward
pass over a frozen open-weights model. No decoding, no reasoning, no escalation: about
200 ms, and the slowest request is a small multiple of the fastest.

**Where it stands.** On the public items of JevBench, against Jev itself:

|                                                  | easy  | standard | hard  | hard ECE | latency |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ------- |
| reflex, frozen Qwen3.5-4B, two orders (`stable`) | 1.000 | 0.917    | 0.685 | 0.081    | ~200 ms |
| reflex, frozen Qwen3.8-27B, two orders           | 1.000 | 0.958    | 0.766 | 0.061    | ~1 s    |
| Jev 1.13.0 (official)                            | 1.000 | 0.986    | 0.730 | 0.031    |         |

Ours are self-run numbers on a suite we have consulted throughout development. The
**official JevBench v1.2 runs** (534 decisions including held-out items, run by the
benchmark's author on an H100) placed reflex (4B, an earlier LoRA configuration) **#5 of 36**
with score 71.7, and reflex-27b **#22** with the highest Intelligence (90.5) and Calibration
(86.2) on the board and hard-tier 75.9 % against Jev's 74.1 %, held back by cost and speed.
Details and what was actually run: [docs/results/jevbench-official.md](docs/results/jevbench-official.md).

**What is proven not to help.** Fine-tuning, in every form we tried. Four LoRA mixes on
public datasets and a distillation from a 27B teacher all won on data shaped like their
training data and lost general judgement on long, ambiguous inputs. GEPA prompt
optimisation did the same in miniature. Wording ensembles, more than two option orders,
and a reasoning cascade behind a fitted escalation trigger were all measured and none of
them ships. What did help was the readout: a lettered yes/no answer, Evidence / Criterion
framing, and averaging two distinct option orders. Every run, with its verdict, is indexed
in [docs/results/README.md](docs/results/README.md).

**How to run it.** `git checkout stable && uv run reflex-serve --stable` on any 16 GB
CUDA GPU. The five-minute version is below.

## Try it in your browser first

**https://kshetrajna12.github.io/reflex/** runs the whole thing on your own GPU through
WebGPU (Chrome, Edge, or Safari 18+) with a 650 MB Qwen3.5-0.8B model. Pick a preset,
load the model once, drop in a photo, press Run. Nothing is uploaded anywhere. It is the
same request format and the same readout as the Python version below, just smaller and
less calibrated. Read it as a demonstration of the mechanism rather than of the served
quality: a frozen 0.8B is not a usable judge, and the model that ships is the 4B
([docs/results/weight-classes.md](docs/results/weight-classes.md)). The page lives in
[`docs/`](docs/): `reflex.js` is the inference module, `app.js` the UI.

## Why would I want this?

Large chat models are great at reasoning but slow and expensive when all you need is a
quick, structured judgment: _which queue, is this spam, how angry is this customer, does
this photo match its caption_. A decision model:

- **returns numbers, not prose** – nothing to parse, no JSON that fails to validate;
- **answers many questions in one pass** – ask 20 questions about one document for
  roughly the cost of one;
- **tells you its confidence, honestly** – after calibration, "85 % sure" really means
  right about 85 % of the time, so you can set thresholds;
- **works on images too** – put a photo in the state and ask typed questions about it.

## Get started in five minutes

You need a Linux machine with an NVIDIA GPU (8 GB of memory is enough for the default
model), Python 3.12, and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kshetrajna12/reflex
cd reflex
git checkout stable                       # the commit and configuration we recommend
uv sync                                   # installs PyTorch (CUDA 13), transformers, etc.
uv run python examples/support_ticket.py  # downloads Qwen3.5-4B (~8 GB) the first time
```

`stable` is a git tag that moves with the configuration, and
[`serving/stable.json`](serving/stable.json) at that commit says what it is: today the
frozen Qwen3.5-4B, the default prompt, no adapter, no calibration file, every question
read in two option orders. Stay on `main` if you would rather follow the experiments.

You should see the ticket example above printed as JSON, plus timings. The very first
call takes ~20 seconds while GPU kernels compile; after that it is fast.

Try it on a photo:

```bash
uv run python examples/image_triage.py path/to/photo.jpg --caption "two cats on a couch"
```

### Apple Silicon (MLX)

```bash
uv sync --extra mlx
uv run reflex-serve --backend mlx --model Qwen/Qwen3-4B --port 8008
```

The MLX backend supports text-only Qwen3 models on the Mac GPU. It quantizes
unquantized weights to 4-bit; pre-quantized MLX checkpoints keep their precision.
It places fixed questions before the variable state, caches matching token prefixes
(up to eight entries / 128 MiB), and reads label logits without generating text.
This prompt layout can change probabilities; check accuracy on your own inputs.

Questions and permutations run serially, not in the Torch backend's packed batch.
Use `--warmup request.json` with a representative SystemOne request to load GPU
kernels and cache its question prefix before the server accepts traffic.
Long states and uncached questions still cost a full prefill. The response schema
stays the same. `state_cache_hit` stays false because this cache reuses question
prefixes; token counts include each branch's state. Images return HTTP 422.
`--adapter`, `--dtype`, and `--device` apply only to Torch. The default backend
remains Torch. The server binds to localhost unless `--host` overrides it.

Run the download-free MLX tests with `uv run --extra mlx --extra dev pytest tests/test_mlx_engine.py`.

### Ask your own questions

```python
from reflex import Engine, SystemOneRequest

engine = Engine.load("Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B")

resp = engine.answer(SystemOneRequest(
    state={"email": "Hi, I was charged twice for my subscription this month, please fix."},
    questions={
        "team": {
            "type": "choice",
            "instructions": "Which team should handle this?",
            "criteria": {"billing": "charges, refunds, invoices",
                         "technical": "bugs, outages",
                         "sales": "pricing, upgrades"},
        },
        "angry": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Is the customer angry?"},
        "urgency": {
            "type": "score",
            "instructions": "How urgent is this?",
            "criteria": ["can wait a week", "should be handled today", "blocked right now"],
        },
    },
))

print(resp.answers["team"].choice, resp.answers["team"].probabilities)
print(resp.answers["angry"].noul)          # probability of "yes"
print(resp.answers["urgency"].score)       # 0.0 .. 2.0, probability-weighted
```

`Engine.load` takes the flags the server takes. To get exactly what the server serves,
including the two option orders, load the manifest:

```python
from reflex.serving import engine_kwargs, load_stable
engine = Engine.load(**engine_kwargs(load_stable()))   # or Engine.load(..., default_permutations=2)
```

### The three question types

| type     | asks                       | you get back                                                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `noul`   | "is this true?"            | `noul`: probability of yes                                                     |
| `choice` | "which one of these?"      | `choice` (best option), `probabilities` for every option, `confidence`         |
| `score`  | "how much, on this scale?" | `score` (weighted position), `probabilities` per level, `legend`, `confidence` |

- `instructions` is the question. `criteria` are the options (choice), the ordered levels
  from low to high (score), or optional descriptions of what "yes" and "no" mean (noul).
- `state` can be a string or any JSON. Put an image anywhere in it as
  `{"type": "image", "source": "<file path, URL, or data: URI>"}`.
- All questions in one request are answered independently and in parallel.

### Run it as a server

```bash
uv run reflex-serve --stable --port 8008
```

```bash
curl -s localhost:8008/v1/systemone -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "state": "The export button crashes in Safari but works in Chrome.",
  "questions": {
    "browser_specific": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Is the bug browser-specific?"},
    "severity": {"type": "score", "instructions": "How severe is this?",
                 "criteria": ["cosmetic", "degraded but there is a workaround", "blocking"]}
  }
}'
```

The request and response shapes are the same as TypeSafe's hosted API, so client code
written for Jev can point at `http://localhost:8008` instead.

`--stable` reads the recommended settings from `serving/stable.json`; spell them out with
`--model` and `--permutations` if you prefer. `--api-key` (or `REFLEX_API_KEY`) puts a
bearer key in front of `/v1/*`, which you want on anything reachable from the internet.

Requests are served one at a time -- one model instance, one accelerator -- but not in
arrival order. The server runs the _cheapest_ pending request first, so an interactive
one-question call does not wait out a multi-question batch. A request that has waited
more than five seconds is promoted ahead of newer arrivals, so batches cannot be starved
by a steady stream of small calls. Each response carries `x-reflex-latency-ms` and
`x-reflex-queue-ms` so queueing is visible from the client.

If your GPU is already running [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), reflex can
read the same label logits off it instead of loading the weights itself:

```bash
uv run reflex-serve --backend sglang --sglang-url http://127.0.0.1:30000 \
    --model Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B --permutations 2 --port 8008
```

Same wire format, same answers (the two backends' probabilities differ by 0.004 at the
median). At 4B the in-process engine is faster, so this is for deployments that already
run SGLang and for the 27B, where it is the better way to serve.
[docs/SERVING.md](docs/SERVING.md) has the launch recipe and the caveats;
[docs/results/sglang-backend.md](docs/results/sglang-backend.md) has the numbers.

### On a Mac (Apple Silicon)

The server also runs on the Mac GPU through PyTorch MPS. Install without the CUDA wheel index,
then pick the device:

```bash
uv sync --no-sources                      # plain PyPI torch, which includes MPS
uv run --no-sync reflex-serve --model Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B --device mps --dtype float16
```

Use `--no-sync` afterwards, or `uv run` re-resolves torch against the CUDA index. `float16`
rather than `bfloat16`. Measured on an M3 Pro (18 GB): Qwen3.5-0.8B answers the request above
in about 130 ms and Qwen3.5-2B a 200-token state with two questions in about 500 ms. Pick a model
whose weights fit in roughly half of unified memory: MPS memory is capped so that a model that
is too large fails with an out-of-memory error instead of swapping the machine to a halt
(Qwen3.5-4B in float16 does not fit in 18 GB).

There is also an MLX backend, which loads the model on the Apple Silicon GPU through
[MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) and keeps a state-prefix cache across requests
(`--cache-entries`, `--cache-gb`):

```bash
uv sync --extra mlx
uv run --no-sync reflex-serve --backend mlx --model Qwen/Qwen3-4B --port 8008
```

It takes `--calibration` and `--max-pack-tokens`. The torch-only flags (`--adapter`,
`--dtype`, `--device`, `--stable`, `--ensemble`, `--prompt-texts`, `--prompt-style`,
`--permutations`, `--max-branch-tokens`) are refused rather than ignored.

## Make the percentages honest (calibration)

Out of the box the numbers are _roughly_ right. To make them trustworthy for
thresholds, run the calibration check. It answers 1,200 exam questions and measures how
well confidence matches accuracy:

```bash
uv run reflex-eval-mmlu --n 1200 --fit-temperature runs/calibration.json
uv run reflex-serve --calibration runs/calibration.json
```

What we measured (lower ECE = more honest; Jev reports 0.031):

| model      | accuracy | honesty (ECE) before | after     |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| Qwen3.5-4B | 72 %     | 0.090                | **0.039** |
| Qwen3-8B   | 71 %     | 0.264                | 0.061     |

The `stable` configuration ships **no** calibration file, because a temperature fitted on
one distribution does not transfer to another, and reading each question in two option
orders already cuts the calibration error on never-trained external sets roughly in half
for free ([docs/results/order-averaging.md](docs/results/order-averaging.md)). Fit a
temperature on data from your own workload, and refit it whenever the model, the prompt or
the precision changes.

## Fine-tune it on your own tasks

Temperature fixes over-confidence but cannot make the model _better_ at a task. For that
you train it, and the recipe is simple: show it labelled examples and penalise it with a
proper scoring rule (log loss or Brier), which is minimised only by the true
probabilities. That is the supervised form of the "RLCD" training Jev uses.

You need labelled data in the same shape as a request, one JSON object per line:

```json
{
  "state": { "comment": "..." },
  "questions": { "toxic": { "type": "noul", "instructions": "..." } },
  "labels": { "toxic": 0.67 },
  "source": "civil_comments"
}
```

Labels can be hard (`"billing"`, `true`, `2`) or **soft** (`0.67`, `{"billing": 0.7, "sales": 0.3}`)
when annotators disagreed; soft labels are what a proper scoring rule wants.

`reflex-data` builds such files from eight public datasets, one recipe each, covering all
three primitives (routing intents, exam questions, toxicity with soft labels,
hallucination checks, passage relevance, response helpfulness, code-review chunks):

```bash
uv run reflex-data mix --out runs/mix_train.jsonl --eval-out runs/mix_eval.jsonl --per-source 800
uv run reflex-calibrate train --data runs/mix_train.jsonl --val runs/mix_eval.jsonl --out runs/lora-mix
uv run reflex-serve --adapter runs/lora-mix --calibration runs/lora-mix/calibration.json
```

What one epoch of that bought on Qwen3.5-4B (held-out, 200 items per source):

|                          | accuracy | calibration error (ECE) |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------- |
| raw model                | 62.7 %   | 0.120                   |
| after LoRA               | 76.8 %   | 0.051                   |
| after LoRA + temperature | 76.8 %   | **0.024**               |

Toxicity went from 50 % to 94 %, hallucination checks from 78 % to 99 %, code-review
"needs a comment" from 50 % to 74 %. Per-source numbers and caveats are in
[docs/results/lora-mix-qwen3.5-4b.md](docs/results/lora-mix-qwen3.5-4b.md).

Training is LoRA by default: minutes on one GPU, base model untouched. `--full` updates
every weight instead, which fits a 4B model on a large GPU but rarely helps for a few
thousand examples. The trainer prints accuracy and calibration per source before and
after, so you can see exactly what the training bought. Your own data plugs in the same
way; `src/reflex/train/recipes.py` shows how each public dataset was mapped onto a
primitive, which is the part to copy.

If you have the inputs but not the labels, `reflex-distill` is the other route: a stronger
model answers your own states through the same prompt, and its distributions become the
targets ([docs/DISTILLATION.md](docs/DISTILLATION.md)). That teacher may reason
(`reflex-distill label --think N`); the student it trains never does.

## Example: triaging a pull request

`examples/pr_review.py` is a small AI PR-review triage built on this: a PR-level state
(title, description, files) answers _what kind of change, how risky, breaking, needs a
migration, does the description match_, and every diff hunk answers _sensitive area,
weakens error handling, debug leftovers, public API change, behaviour change, and how
much a senior reviewer would want to look_. Code aggregates the numbers and prints the
hunks to hand to a reasoning model or a human.

```bash
uv run python examples/pr_review.py --repo pydantic/pydantic --pr 13824
```

```
kind            feature    feature   98%  bugfix    1%  chore    0%
risk            1.96 / 3   (max hunk needs-eyes 2.02 / 3)
breaking          29%      needs migration   27%      description matches   82%
hunks           40 reviewed, 0 skipped   logic hunks 20   test files changed 7
escalate to a reasoning model / human (P(needs a careful read) >= 50%):

    81%  pydantic-core/src/serializers/type_serializers/counter.rs  ...    +164/-0
1.2s PR level, 13.3s for 40 hunks
```

The raw model already orders things sensibly; the point of the design is that the
outputs are numbers, so thresholds are yours, and with your own history of reverted or
hotfixed PRs the calibrator can be trained so "80 %" means 80 % on your codebase.

The [browser demo](https://kshetrajna12.github.io/reflex/) has the same triage at the
bottom of the page: it fetches a public PR from the GitHub API and runs it on the 0.8B
model on your GPU. Expect a rougher ordering than the 4B; it is the same questions.

## How it compares

On the public items of [JevBench](https://github.com/fstandhartinger/jevbench), a
benchmark for Jev-class decision models, the **frozen** Qwen3.5-4B with reflex's default
prompt, reading each question in two option orders, scores 1.000 / 0.917 / 0.685 on the
easy / standard / hard tiers, with hard-tier calibration error 0.081 and no calibration
file. Jev itself scores 1.000 / 0.986 / 0.730 at ECE 0.031, and the strongest other open
4B rebuild 1.000 / 0.986 / 0.613, on the same items. If you have a 60 GB GPU, the same
code on the frozen Qwen3.8-27B reaches 0.958 / 0.766 at ECE 0.061, in about a second per
request ([docs/results/weight-classes.md](docs/results/weight-classes.md)).

Those are our own runs. The public items have been consulted throughout development, so
they are a development suite rather than an independent test; both configurations are
filed on JevBench and queued by its author (issues
[#3](https://github.com/fstandhartinger/jevbench/issues/3) and
[#5](https://github.com/fstandhartinger/jevbench/issues/5)).

Fine-tuning turned out to be a trap for general use: the adapters trained here improved
data that looked like their training data and cost accuracy on long, ambiguous inputs,
and prompt optimisation with GEPA did the same in miniature. The numbers, the controls
and the two prompt changes that _did_ transfer are in
[docs/results/frozen-vs-trained.md](docs/results/frozen-vs-trained.md); the public-item
comparison is in [docs/results/jevbench-public.md](docs/results/jevbench-public.md).

**Every experiment, in order, with its verdict:
[docs/results/README.md](docs/results/README.md).** That index is the honest version of
this section: what was tried, what won, and what was thrown away.

## How it works, in one paragraph

The state is run through the model once and its internal cache is kept. Every question is
then run as a separate branch that can see the state but not the other questions, all in
the same forward pass. Instead of letting the model write an answer, we look at what it
_would_ say next, keep only the answer labels (A, B, C …, and a lettered pair for
yes/no), and turn those scores into percentages. Each question is asked twice inside that
same pass, with its options in two different orders, and the two readings are averaged,
which is the cheapest accuracy and honesty we found. A single "temperature" number,
fitted on labelled data, can make the percentages honest on your own data. There is no
decoding loop, no reasoning and no escalation anywhere on that path: one request is one
forward pass, which is what keeps it under 300 ms. The details, the
design trade-offs, and the mapping to the Jev write-ups are in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); why the fast pass is the whole product is
in [docs/VISION.md](docs/VISION.md).

## Good to know

- Works with Qwen3.5 (default, handles images), Qwen3, and Qwen3-VL checkpoints. Any
  size that fits your GPU; `--model Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B` runs on very small cards.
- The browser demo runs all questions of a request in one batched forward pass, but
  re-reads the state for every question and does not cache it between requests, so it
  is fine for a handful of questions, not hundreds.
- A `choice` question can have up to 26 options; `score` can have 2 to 10 levels.
- `--device mps` runs the server on an Apple Silicon GPU, `--backend sglang` on an SGLang
  server; `--permutations N` sets how many option orders each question is read in.
- The model is not magic: check its answers on a handful of your own examples before
  trusting it, and use the confidence numbers to route uncertain cases to a person.
- `reflex.think` lets a model reason before the labels are read. It is an offline tool
  for teacher labelling and experiments only, never a serving mode; the server has no
  flag for it.
- Tests: `uv sync --extra dev && uv run pytest` (the GPU tests download small models).
